# project-disassembly
the project for making the drones from murder drones a reality (or atleast as close as possible and within a reasonable budget).



# Worker drone operating system
the operating system is planned to be somewhat built from the ground up and the rest being linux components, such as the kernel.



# the drone core's
the core contains all the computer parts, for now they will contain pre-existing boards, but were planning on making custom boards, they are also interchangable allowing for upgrade.
